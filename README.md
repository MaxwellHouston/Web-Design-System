#Web Design Template#

##Info##
This project for Codecademy was based on showing a template for a possible website.

I laid out the required information for the website template but also designed the guide to follow the design.

I've also added a few styles such as ```box-shadow``` to the original project.

Please reach out if you have any comments or improvements. Thank You

##grid-system##
Recently I added a seperate layout CSS sheet to align the page using a grid system.

If you want to switch between the grid and original layouts, just change the CSS file linked in index.html.
